# Exploring Generative AI (A Personal Use Case)

## Context

I’m a developer, living with my partner, and have a relatively stable life.  
But a few months ago, I went deep into a strange new space: **AI-generated NSFW content**.

At first, it was curiosity.  
Then it became... routine.  
And then, a low-key obsession.

I wasn’t addicted to the content itself — I was addicted to the control.  
To type exactly what I wanted… and getting it.  
No awkwardness. No friction. Just a perfect visual output, on demand.

## Use Case Mapping: Features That Mattered

I tried over a dozen tools.  
Here’s a rough summary (subjective):

| Feature             | UI Experience | Prompt Flexibility | Realism | Manipulation Tactics |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Video Generation | ✘ Cluttered   | ✘ Basic             | ⭐⭐      | Aggressive upsells    |
| AI Chat / Companion   | ✔ Sleek       | ✔ Good              | ⭐⭐⭐     | Gated features        |
| Image Generation | ✔ Clean        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐              | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ❌ None                |

> The last one surprised me. It was calm. Functional. No noise.  
> It didn't push me to stay longer or spend more — and weirdly, that made me use it *less*, not more.

## Why I’m sharing this

This isn’t a review. It’s not a pitch.  
It’s just a snapshot of a weird behavior loop I found myself stuck in — and the one thing that helped me step back.

If you’re in a similar rabbit hole, maybe this helps. Or maybe not.  
But if you’re curious:
